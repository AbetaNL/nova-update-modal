# Nova Update modal
A Laravel Nova hack to display update form as a modal

Current Supported Nova Version: **2.9.4**  

As new versions of Nova are released, if changes are made to any of the views that this package has to overwrite, a new version will need to be released. Composer version constraints should prevent installs on versions that aren't supported.

**IMPORTANT**  
This is a work-in-progress package and is liable to change. Advised not to use in production environments unless you know what you are doing and have complete faith in the code working.
